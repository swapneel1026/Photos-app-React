        Hero can be anyone. Even a man knowing something as simple and
        reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him
        know the world hadn’t ended. You fight like a younger man, there’s
        nothing held back. It’s admirable, but mistaken. When their enemies were
        at the gates the Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to
        protect the city. It wasn’t considered an honor, it was a public
        service.
